# r4pr (Region 4 Project Reports)

This package provides a R Markdown template for R4 I&M Project Reports.

## Installing r4pr

To use `r4pr` and generate the pdf Project Reports from the template, you'll need:

1. **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)**
1. **[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)**
1. **LaTeX distribution**: If you don't know what this means, we recommend you use `tinytex`. Install `tinytex` in R using the following commands and following the onscreen prompts: 

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("tinytex")
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```
    
    Other LaTeX distribution options include [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/download) for Windows,
    [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) for Mac OS X, and
    [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-140003) for Linux. This template should be OS-agnostic, but has
    not been tested outside of 64-bit Windows 7.
    
1. **pandoc**: If you're using a relatively recent version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/), pandoc is included.  Using `r4pr` outside of RStudio will require a recent version of [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).

R, Rtools, RStudio, Microsoft Access, and PDFtk Server will require administrative priveleges but the installation of packages after this initial install will not.  It's likely Microsoft Access is already installed on your DOI computer.  `MABMreportr` is tested only on PCs running Microsoft Windows.

You also need an up-to-date, local copy of the MABM database.  Currently, this applies to two people in the world, but it will be easy to provide a remotely accessible location for this database down the road.

With the installation formalities out of the way, install and load the MABMreportr package to access its functionality.


## Installing the Template

Install the template directly:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adamdsmith/r4pr")
```

This will install the package `r4pr`. Once installed, the template will be available within the R Markdown templates as shown below:
