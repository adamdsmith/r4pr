# FIGURES AND TABLES

You can generate figures two ways:

Inside R using a code chunk...
 
```{r ex-fig1, out.width="75%", fig.cap="I created this figure in R.", echo=TRUE}
hist(rnbinom(10000, mu = 10, size = 2))
```

...or by referencing an image/photo files stored in the `images` directory. This again requires a named R chunk to help you with referencing the figure later...

```{r ex-fig2, out.width = "50%", fig.cap="Look at these logos! Amazing!", echo=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/usfws-refuges-logos.png")
```

Tables are always tricky, but it's generally best to use the `kable` function from the `knitr` package. We also recommend looking into the `kableExtra` package as well if you want more customization options. In any case, these will be created within R, again in a named R chunk for easy cross-referencing (see next section).

```{r ex-table, echo = TRUE}
im_team <- data.frame(Name = c("Janet Ertel", "David Richardson", "Adam Smith",
                               "Amanda Bessler", "Michelle Moorman", 
                               "Zach Cravens"),
                      Role = c("Supreme Leader", "Crotchety Curmudgeon", 
                               "Data Therapist", "Eternal Optimist",
                               "USGS Convert", "Greenhorn"))
knitr::kable(im_team, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = "I and M Team members and roles as of January 2019.")
```

# CROSS-REFERENCES

You can easily reference and link to figures and tables throughout the document. For example, to link to Figure 1, we simply use `\@ref(label)` where `label` is the R code chunk ID preceded by `fig:` for figures or `tab:` for tables. So for the logo picture above, the R code chunk was "ex-fig" meaning we can reference it via `\@ref(fig:ex-fig1)`. When displayed as text, it only uses the appropriate figure number (e.g., 1, 2, etc.), so you have to use "Fig." or "Figure" on your own... Here goes: see Figure \@ref(fig:ex-fig1) or Figure \@ref(fig:ex-fig2), whichever pleases you most. Table \@ref(tab:ex-table) is pretty exciting too, if you'll recall.

# CITATIONS

To cite an entry from your BibTex database, use `@key` or `[@key]` (the latter puts the citation in parentheses. For example `@RCoreTeam2018` is rendered as R Core Team (2018), and `[@Flint2013]` generates "(Flint 2013)". For completeness, @Flint2013 does not use R [@RCoreTeam2018] for his manuscript.
